# [Flexmail](https://flexmail.vercel.app)

Flexmail is a disposable temporary email generator, which can be used for wide range of purposes including protection from spammers. `1secmail` servers are trusted to be one of the fastest servers when it comes to email generators. Hence a fast and customizable frontend was much needed.

* **Why this:** Can be used to generate emails instantly, with the name of your choice.
* **Saves a lot of efforts:** Several temporary email generators are very hectic to use as they have high latency.
* **No limit on requests:** Users can fire unlimited number of fetch requests without time boundation.
* **Clean UI:** No longer visit those ad-ridden websites to generate temporary mails.
* **Attachments support:** With this release, users will be able to download attachments from the mails.
* **Longer disposable period:** The `1secmail` server provides a disposable time of over `120 minutes`.
* **Low latency requests:** Each request from the client responds with latency `<50ms`.
